# R-TidyTuesdayChallenges

Tidy Tuesday is a weekly dataset/problem that the folks at R provide. Here are some of my attempts to play around with the datasets

1. December 2020: Compelted Tidy Tuesday focused on Media Franchises (think Batman, Pokemon etc).
R code focused on the largest media franchises, when they originated, and how much revenue they have been able to generate. 

2. January 2021: Completed Tidy Tuesday focused on Transit costs (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-01-05/readme.md)
The repository includes my R script and several graphs made looking at Transprot cost, primarily in the United States and China, where the data was most readily available. 

3. March 2021:Completed Tidy Tuesday focused on Super Bowl Ad performance. I attached my R script and several graphs examining Ad performance from the past 20 Super Bowls.
