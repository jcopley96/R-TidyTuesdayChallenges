# R-TidyTuesdayChallenges

Tidy Tuesday is a weekly dataset/problem that the folks at R provide. Here are some of my attempts to play around with the datasets

December 2020:
Compelted Tidy Tuesday focused on Media Franchises (think Batman, Pokemon etc).
R code focused on the largest media franchises, when they originated, and how much revenue they have been able to generate. 

January 2021:
Completed Tidy Tuesday focused on Transit costs (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-01-05/readme.md)
The repository includes my R script and several graphs made looking at Transprot cost, primarily in the United States and China, where the data was most readily available.
