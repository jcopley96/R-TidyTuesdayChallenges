# R-TidyTuesdayChallenges

Tidy Tuesday is a weekly dataset/problem that the folks at R provide. Here are some of my attempts to play around with the datasets

January 7th 2021:
Completed Tidy Tuesday focused on Transit costs (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-01-05/readme.md)
The repository includes my R script and several graphs made looking at Transprot cost, primarily in the United States and China, where the data was most readily available.
